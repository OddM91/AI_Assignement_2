# AI_Assignement_2

I am gonna be doing the Norwegian Airlines stock market prediction, and for this I decided to use Random Forest Regression. 
The reason to that is this is a case that has a continuous target value and not a binary True/False, Yes/No to decide discrete classes so I would not be able to use classification algorithems. And then when deciding between Linear Regression and Random Forest I found that Random Forest would be the better choice.
